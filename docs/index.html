                        Entering the tech industry feels like the natural progression for anyone interested in the
                        humanities.
                        The web is just as much a social creation as it a technical one.

                        The creator of the world wide web designed it for a social effect--to help
                        people work together.
                        The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world.

                        We clump into families, associations, and companies.
                        <br>
                        We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner.
