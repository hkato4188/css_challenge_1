            <h2>Hi, there!</h2>
            <p>
                I am a learning-oriented, resourceful professional transitioning into the tech industry as a
                software engineer. <br>
                I have experience working to identify, develop, and execute business operation procedures
                and software development objectives. <br>
                My professional background is in project management, data analytics, compliance, consulting, higher
                education and training. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Historian ➕ Programmer</h2>
            <p>Tech feels like the natural progression for anyone interested in the humanities.
                The web is just as much a social creation as it a technical one. <br>
                The creator of the world wide web (Tim Berners Lee) designed it for a social effect--to help people work
                together--not as a technical toy. <br>
                The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into
                families, associations, and companies. <br>
                We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner. <br>
                The Web does not just connect machines, it connects people. <br>
