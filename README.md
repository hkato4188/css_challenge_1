Sample resume page made emphasizing CSS

I created a resume webpage with a basic HTML outline.
Styled the html elements and showed how you can decorate without getting too heavy into CSS.

In this repo, in order to highlight and differentiate the functions between HTML and CSS I restructured my resume to make it more engaging with the power of CSS.

See other repository for same website designed primarily through HTML element styling.
