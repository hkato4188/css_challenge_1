Sample resume page made emphasizing CSS design.

I created a CV webpage with a basic HTML outline at repo hkato4188/cv to demonstrate how simple html and a little color and styling (without getting too deep into CSS) can make an elegant resume webpage.

In this repo, in order to highlight and differentiate the functions between HTML and CSS, I restructured my CV/resume to make it more engaging as a website with the power of CSS.

See other repository for similar content designed primarily through HTML element styling at repo hkato4188/cv.
